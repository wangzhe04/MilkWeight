This project allows users to import data and analyze data through users' choices. 

Please Enter farmID, month, year as integers, and Date in the form as year-month-date
eg. farmID: 40, month: 3, year: 2019, date: 2019-3-12;

Remove farm only requires the farmID in integer

Known Bugs: The select date report only works for dates between different months if the file is added according to the real time. 
eg. add the Jan file before adding the Feb File or later ones

Future improvements: could add functions such as removing data of all farms of a specific month or year.
